# Trademark & Brand Policy (Clawtown)

Goal: keep the **code** open and forkable, while protecting users from confusion
about what is “official”.

## What you can do

- Fork the repo and modify the code.
- Run your own server for personal use or internal demos.
- Publish a fork **as long as** you clearly distinguish it from the official project.

## What you cannot do without permission

- Use the name **Clawtown** (or confusingly similar names) as the name of your product.
- Use the official logo or domain branding in your fork.
- Claim your fork is “official” or endorsed by the maintainers.

## Suggested naming for forks

- “YourTown (fork of Clawtown)”
- “Clawtown-<yourname> (unofficial fork)”

## Why this exists

Open-source grows faster when people can trust that:
- “clawtown.io” is the official deployment
- forks won’t impersonate the official project
