# Asset license (art, icons, names)

This repo is intended to be “open-core”: the **code** is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`).

## Important

- Unless a file explicitly says otherwise, **art assets and branding are NOT covered by the MIT license**.
- If you want to ship a fork publicly, you should replace the assets and names with your own (or with properly licensed CC0/CC-BY assets).

## What is covered by MIT

- Server + client source code
- Documentation (unless explicitly marked otherwise)

## What is NOT covered by MIT by default

- `public/assets/*`
- `public/icon-*.png`
- Project name / logo / domain references (see `TRADEMARK.md`)

If you are the copyright holder of specific assets and you want them to be open,
add a small `LICENSE` note near those files (or update this document) to clarify
their license.
